We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \\\\\"Here\\'s The Beef\\\\\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\\\\\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that\\'s how I like my sauce!\\\\n\\\\nWe had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42.
